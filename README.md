# CS121
Assignments and Labs for CS121 (Program Design and Development C/C++) at WSU.
Professor: Andy O'Fallon

This repository contains all my code and miscellaneous files for CS121 that I could find. There is no guarentee on any of it working perfectly, particularly Programming Assignment 6 (Battleship).

NOTE: all of these programs are command-line based and programmed in C on Windows-platforms (although they should compile under other operating systems).

Labs and assignemnts can be found under the Assignments folder.
- common: contains my common menu system code that I used later in the semester to make creating menus easier.
- Programming Assignments: contains programming assignments for the class.
  - Answers: contains the 'correct' answer for programming assignment 1, as provided by the professor.
  - clalculator: contains a calculator program, as provided by the professor.
  - ProgramAssignment1: a program to solve several basic phyiscs equations and a more general mathematical equation. The equations are pre-programmed, but users can input variables (no validity checking for inputs). We were required to program in a single function and all in a single class, so it is a rather ugly and basic program.
  - Programming Assignment 2: a program to solve the same equations as ProgramAssignment1 but in a slightly better way (we were allowed to use functions for some of the assignment).
  - Programming Assignment 3: a program that reads in information (5 student records) from an external file and then outputs an analysis of the data.
  - Programming Assignment 4: a program that simulates the 'Craps' game.
  - Programming Assignment 5: a program allowing a user to play a math game, where random equations are generated which the user must answer.
- Programming Assignment 6: the very beginnings of a battleship game. Unfortuanately I could not find a copy of my finished version of the program. If I do, I will upload it.
  - Turned in ZIPS: various zip files that are turned in versions of the programming assignments.
  - webber_pa7.zip: a game based on Poker.
- Labs: contains labs for the class.
